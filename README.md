### Hi

My name is Mateusz. I am a frontend developer with a big passion to my work. I started learning programming in 2011. I found a lot of fun in teaching programming. In my private life I am a husband and a father. I love to play board games and read books (my collection counts ca. 1500 volumes).

You can find more infomation about me on my website. Feel free for write to me in any cases.
